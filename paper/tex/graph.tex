\section{Graph Structure and implementation}

Edges in the graph are treated as undirected. The information stored on an edge
is:
\begin{itemize}
\item The vertex IDs: $v_1$ and $v_2$ of the edge endpoints.
\item The timestamp creation.
\end{itemize}
We use the dangling edge model \cite{Chairunnanda12} for our vertex-based
partitioning scheme
