\begin{abstract}
In this paper we will focus on collaborations between software developers, ``Social Coding'' and OSS development. We will discuss how these collaborations function by analysing one of the most popular social coding website - GitHub. We are particularly interested in studying what motivates a developer to contribute into a project. The large amount of projects that a developer can join and contribute seems overwhelming. Yet, somehow, some of the projects seem to be more attractive to developers and have larger communities that are willing to  contribute to their development. A simple intuition of this phenomenon would be that popular projects attract developers simply because they are popular, like a snowball effect.

While this might be true for some projects, various counterexamples can be found in which a project quickly gathers a significant following, with no obvious reason.
