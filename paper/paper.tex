\begin{abstract}
Social coding websites have experienced a significant rise in popularity in the past few years and so has the development and use of Open Source Software. GitHub is one of the popular social coding website with more than four million users and six million repositories. For a typical new user joining GitHub it can become a daunting task to interact and grow in this vast online community. This calls for research on what typical behaviours are observed and rewarded in such a diverse network and what useful information can be extracted by analyzing previous trends.  In this paper we try to find the rationale behind why people follow projects on GitHub. We discuss some previous work that throws light on similar subjects. To answer the question, we collect the information of 618,353 users and 868,177 repositories on GitHub.
