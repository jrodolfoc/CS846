\begin{abstract}
Recently, platforms such as SourceForge, GitHub and CodePlex have experienced a rise in popularity. This provides a large amount of opportunities for developers to share ideas, common interests and to improve their skills. But this large amount of options can also be overwhelming. Yet, somehow, some of the projects seem to be more attractive to developers. While some projects seem to grow on popularity simply because they are already popular, some counterexamples can be found in which a project quickly gathers a significant following, with no obvious reason. Our study will focus on analyzing the social network of GitHub and provide some explanations into why do people follow specific projects.

We collected information of 618,353 users and 868,177 repositories through GitHub's API v3. We formulated four hypothesis in an attempt to characterize the motivations behind developers following a project. The hypothesis are: (i) popularity grows because the owner of the project is popular; (ii) popularity grows because the number of popular contributors working on it; (iii) popularity is affected by the programming language; (iv) popularity is determined by the category that it belongs to.

Our results show that (i) and (ii) have no correlation at all, while hypothesis (iii) showed some correlation between the popularity of the programming language and the number of projects amongst the most popular ones. Finally, hypothesis (iv) showed a high number of popular projects being frameworks or widgets / plugins, which we believe show a trend towards web development productivity tools. But the small sample size collected for (iv), 100 projects, makes it difficult to reason about the validity of the hypothesis.
